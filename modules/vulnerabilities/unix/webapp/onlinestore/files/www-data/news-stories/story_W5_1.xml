   	<p>The anual workshop "Craft Me A Dream" was held in Coventry this year. It was a colourful event, which saw hobbyists, furnishings giants and small boutiques gather and explore this year's trends.</p>
	<p>'Pantone recently announced the Colour of the Year as Greenery. In my opinion, this is a perfect fit. It represents the life of the nature surrounding us. It represents rejuvenation, revitalisation, communion with nature. 2017 is the year we bring nature into our homes, and it will be beautiful.', says Kristin Ebersbach, a freelance interior designer from Germany.</p>
	<p>Indeed, the Greenery colour has been featured by many stands. We saw curtains, wallpapers, rugs and linen in the beautiful shade. Business Floors Inc featured a new bathroom furniture design inspired by it. The pieces come in the Brown Rice colour with two thick Greenery lines in key places, textured as leaves. The minimal design exudes simplicity, brining the focus on the nature.</p>
	<p>The surprise of the event came from Madison Fireplace, this year's celebrated furnishings company at the Cozy Furniture Awards 2017. Their stand showcased an absolutely amazing masonry fireplace. The stones were Red Dahlia shades, and the fireplace was partially covered with vibrant, emerald moss. The company used new technology in order to be able to keep the moss thriving on the hot fireplace. It was the ultimate tribute to nature, and the star of the show!</p>
