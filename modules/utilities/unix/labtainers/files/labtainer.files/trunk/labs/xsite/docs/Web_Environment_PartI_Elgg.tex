%\section{Lab Environment}

This lab runs in the Labtainer framework,
available at http://my.nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers.
That site includes links to a pre-built virtual machine
that has Labtainers installed, however Labtainers can
be run on any Linux host that supports Docker containers.

From your labtainer-student directory start the lab using:
\begin{verbatim}
    labtainer xsite
\end{verbatim}
Links to this lab manual and to an empty lab report will be displayed.  If you create your lab report on a separate system,
be sure to copy it back to the specified location on your Linux system.

\subsection{Environment Configuration}
This lab includes three networked computers as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:topology}. 
The "vuln-site" runs the Apache web server and the {\tt Elgg} web
applications.  The "attacker" and "victim" computers each include
the Firefox browser.  Use the browser {\tt Web Developer} / {\tt Network}
tool (upper right menu), to 
inspect the HTTP requests and responses.

\paragraph{Starting the Apache Server.}
The Apache web server will be running when the lab
commences.  If you need to restart the web server, use
the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
   % sudo systemctl restart httpd
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{The {\tt Elgg} Web Application.}
We use an open-source web application called {\tt Elgg} in this lab.
{\tt Elgg} is a web-based social-networking application. 
It is already set up in on the vuln-site.
We have also created several user accounts on the {\tt Elgg} server and the credentials are given below.
