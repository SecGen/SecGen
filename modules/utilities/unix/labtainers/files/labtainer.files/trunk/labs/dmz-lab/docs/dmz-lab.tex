\section{Overview}
This lab requires that you configure a DMZ using iptables on two gateway components.

\section{Lab Environment}
This lab runs in the Labtainer framework,
available at http://my.nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers.
That site includes links to a pre-built virtual machine
that has Labtainers installed, however Labtainers can
be run on any Linux host that supports Docker containers.

From your labtainer-student directory start the lab using:
\begin{verbatim}
    labtainer dmz-lab
\end{verbatim}
\noindent A link to this lab manual will be displayed.  

\section{Network Configuration}
This lab includes several networked computers as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:topology}.
Note however that your instance of the lab will have different IP addresses
for some of the components.
When the lab starts, you will get several virtual terminals, one connected to each
component.

The outer gateway and the remote gateway each reach the Internet via an ISP with 
address 198.18.0.1.  The local site has a network address of 198.18.1.0/24.  The remote
site has a network address of 203.0.113.0/24.

Initially, the DMZ is in name only.

\section{Lab Tasks}
Configure the inner\_gateway and outer\_gateway such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Remote users can only access the web server, e.g., via wget www.example.com, using
HTTP, HTTPS and SSH.
\item Local users can reach the internet via the ISP, e.g., wget www.google.com
\item Local users can reach the local web server via HTTP, HTTPS, SSH and MYSQL
\end{itemize}

Use the /etc/rc.local scripts on the inner and outer gateways to issue iptables directives.
Respect the comments in the rc.local scripts regarding sections that should not be modified.
Demonstrate your DMZ by issuing the following commands, without any additional changes to iptables.
\begin{enumerate}
\item On the remote\_ws (hank): {\tt sudo nmap www.example.com}
\item On the ws1 (tom): {\tt sudo nmap www.example.com}
\item On the ws1 (tom): {\tt wget www.google.com}
\end{enumerate}
\noindent If you make any changes to iptables in the course of your testing, restart your testing from
item (1) above.

\section{Submission}
After finishing the lab, go to the terminal on your Linux system that was used to start the lab and type:
\begin{verbatim}
    stoplab dmz-lab
\end{verbatim}
When you stop the lab, the system will display a path to the zipped lab results on your Linux system.  Provide that file to 
your instructor, e.g., via the Sakai site.
