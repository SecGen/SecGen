# Security Audit Remit of <%= self.business_name %>

## About us
We are <%= self.business_name %>, an SME business.  We have a fairly high risk threshold, and a restricted budget.  We are aiming to get a new product to market in the next 6 months.

## Our security policy
Complete copies of our security policy documents are available via the Intranet server.  We do not have any other formal security policies.

## Backups
We backup all our data (including code and documents) via <%= self.local_backup %>.  We also do a weekly backup to <%= self.remote_backup %>.

## Office location
We have leased <%= self.business_location %> for our operations (including employees and server rooms) for the last 4 years.  The other areas of the building are used by third parties.  We have <%= self.physical_security %> to control access to our rooms.

## IT infrastructure
Our IT team developed the servers that are currently deployed.

Our network design is to have a web server connected to an Internet accessible IP address (DMZ).  All other servers and end user desktops will be connected to an intranet with any connections out to the Internet via NAT.

Our systems include:

* A web server with network services

* An intranet server, hosting our security policy documents for internal access

* Desktop systems

The Web host will eventually be processing credit card transactions; hopefully thousands of transactions every month.

## Your remit
Your team has been contracted to provide a grey-box security audit of our business.  It is your remit to produce a Security Assessment Report.  This security assessment must take into account any relevant security issues, including management and policy, physical and (of particular importance) digital security.  You should decide on a security testing methodology and report structure that meets our security needs.

Make use of any software tools of your choosing to carry out the technical analysis.  The report should include the results of a detailed security audit, highlighting priority issues and security vulnerabilities and risks, with recommended mitigations.  Please consider our organisation profile when making your recommendations.

Your report will point the way forward for our new IT Manager who has recently been appointed following the dismissal of the previous post holder.  Your Report may also be considered in an ongoing employment tribunal related to the dismissal of the previous IT Manager.
