## Uptime

At a console, ==run:==

```bash
uptime
```
`15:32:38 up 4 days, 23:50,  4 users,  load average: 1.01, 1.24, 1.17`

A common goal is to aim for "five nines" availability (99.999%). If you only have one server, that means keeping it running constantly, other than for scheduled maintenance.

==In your log book, list a few legitimate security reasons for performing off-line maintenance.==

## Copy

The simplest of Unix copy commands, is `cp`. `cp` takes a local source and destination, and can recursively copy contents from one file or directory to another.

Make a directory to store your backups. ==Run:==

```bash
mkdir /home/<%= $main_user %>/backups/
```

==Make a backup copy of your /etc/passwd file:==

```bash
cp /etc/passwd /home/<%= $main_user %>/backups/
```

We have made a backup of a source file (/etc/passwd), to our destination directory (/home/<%= $main_user %>/backups/). Note that we lost the metadata associated with the file, including file ownership and permissions:

```bash
ls -la /home/<%= $main_user %>/backups/passwd
ls -la /etc/passwd
```
Note and take the time to ==understand the differences in the output== from these two commands. Notably the backup file is now owned by <%= $main_user %> (and also belongs to that user's primary group).

## SSH (secure shell) and SCP (secure copy)

Using SSH (secure shell), `scp` (secure copy) can transfer files securely (encrypted) over a network.
> This replaces the old insecure rcp command, which sends files over the network in-the-clear (not encrypted). Rcp should never be used.

==Backup your /etc/ directory to the backup_server== computer using `scp`:

```bash
sudo scp -pr /etc/ <%= $main_user %>@<%= $server_ip %>:/home/<%= $main_user %>/ssh_backup/
```
> You will be prompted for your local password, to confirm the hosts fingerprint ("yes"), and the remote password (which is the same).
> This copy may take some time, feel free to open another terminal console (Ctrl-T), to read the scp man page while you wait.

Read the scp man page to ==determine what the `-p` and `-r` flags do==.

> Hint: "`man scp`", press "q" to quit.

Now, lets add a file to /etc, and repeat the backup:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo > /etc/hi'
sudo scp -pr /etc/ <%= $main_user %>@<%= $server_ip %>:/home/<%= $main_user %>/ssh_backup/
```

Note that the program re-copies all of the files entirely, regardless of whether (or how much) they have changed.

==SSH to your backup_server system==, to look at your backup files:

> `ssh *username*@*server-ip-address*` will log you in with *username* on the system. Assuming the remote computer has the same user account available (as is the case with the VMs provided), you can omit "username", and just run "`ssh *ip-address*`", and you will be prompted to provide authentication for your own account, as configured on their system.

So, that is:
```bash
ssh <%= $server_ip %>
```
> Enter your password when prompted

List the files that have been backed up:

```bash
ls -la ssh_backup/
```

**Exit ssh**:
> `exit`
>
> (Or Ctrl-D)
>
> Note, this command will close your bash shell, if you are not logged in via ssh.
